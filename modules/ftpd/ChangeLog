	* Integrated patch from Keith Vetter <keith@softbook.com>
	Patch fixed several bugs.  Allowed users to log in as
	both 'anonymous' and 'ftp' by default instead of just anonymous.
	Fixed syntax error with the 'socket -server' line in ftpd::server when
	'myaddr' is specified.  Fixed the argument specifications for
	cmdline:getoptions in ftpd::config so that arguments are required for
	the -logCmd and the -fsCmd.
