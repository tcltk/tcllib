.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBcontrol\fR package provides a variety of commands that
provide additional flow of control structures beyond the
built-in ones provided by Tcl.  These are commands that in
many programming languages might be considered \fIkeywords\fR,
or a part of the language itself.  In Tcl, control flow structures
are just commands like everything else.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBcontrol::control \fIcommand option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
The \fBcontrol\fR command is used as a configuration command
for customizing the other public commands of the control package.
The \fIcommand\fR argument names the command to be customized.
The set of valid \fIoption\fR and subsequent arguments are
determined by the command being customized, and are documented
with the command.
.TP
\fBcontrol::assert \fIexpr \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
When disabled, the \fBassert\fR command behaves exactly like
the \fBno-op\fR command.

When enabled, the \fBassert\fR command evaluates \fIexpr\fR as
an expression (in the same way that \fBexpr\fR evaluates its
argument).  If evaluation reveals that \fIexpr\fR is not a valid
boolean expression (according to [\fBstring is boolean -strict\fR]),
an error is raised.  If \fIexpr\fR evaluates to a true boolean value
(as recognized by \fBif\fR), then \fBassert\fR returns an empty string.
Otherwise, the remaining arguments to \fBassert\fR are used
to construct a message string.  If there are no arguments, the
message string is "assertion failed: $expr".  If there are arguments,
they are joined by \fBjoin\fR to form the message string.  The 
message string is then appended as an argument to a callback command,
and the completed callback command is evaluated in the global namespace.

The \fBassert\fR command can be customized by the \fBcontrol\fR
command in two ways:

[\fBcontrol::control assert enabled \fR?\fIboolean\fR?] queries or
sets whether \fBcontrol::assert\fR is enabled.  When called without
a \fIboolean\fR argument, a boolean value is returned indicating
whether the \fBcontrol::assert\fR command is enabled.  When called
with a valid boolean value as the \fIboolean\fR argument, the
\fBcontrol::assert\fR command is enabled or disabled to match the
argument, and an empty string is returned.

[\fBcontrol::control assert callback \fR?\fIcommand\fR?] queries or sets
the callback command that will be called by an enabled \fBassert\fR on
assertion failure.  When called without a \fIcommand\fR argument, the
current callback command is returned.  When called with a \fIcommand\fR
argument, that argument becomes the new assertion failure callback
command.  Note that an assertion failure callback command is always
defined, even when \fBassert\fR is disabled.  The default callback
command is [\fBreturn -code error\fR].
.PP
Note that \fBcontrol::assert\fR has been written so that in
combination with [\fBnamespace import\fR], it is possible to
use enabled \fBassert\fR commands in some namespaces and disabled
\fBassert\fR commands in other namespaces at the same time.  
.CS
\fB% package require control
% control::control assert enabled 1
% namespace eval one namespace import ::control::assert
% control::control assert enabled 0
% namespace eval two namespace import ::control::assert
% one::assert {1 == 0}
assertion failed: 1 == 0
% two::assert {1 == 0}\fR
.CE
This capability is useful so that debugging efforts can be independently
controlled module by module.
.TP
\fBcontrol::do \fIbody while|until test\fR
The \fBdo\fR command executes body as a script repeatedly \fBuntil\fR
the expression \fBtest\fR becomes true or as long as (\fBwhile\fR)
\fBtest\fR is true, depending on the second argument. It handles all
exceptional cases (\fBbreak\fR, \fBcontinue\fR, \fBerror\fR, etc.) 
correctly, except [\fBreturn -code\fR] which is impossible to handle
by script-only control structures. For more details see the
documentation of the \fBwhile\fR command which this implementation is
internally based on.
.TP
\fBcontrol::no-op \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
The \fBno-op\fR command takes any number of arguments and does nothing.
It returns an empty string.
