	* rc4.test: Added basic command tests.
	* rc4c.tcl: Critcl implementation.
	* rc4.tcl:  Support critcl implementation.

	* rc4.tcl:  Storing the state as a list and using lset is faster
	than using an array provided we have a built-in lset
	command. Added both versions and switch appropriately to get the
	fastest implementation for the tcl version. Tested 8.2 - 8.5.
