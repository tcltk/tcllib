2006-09-28  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>
        
        * ldap.tcl      Nasty bug in ReceiveBytes, not detecting
                        partial results correctly.
        
2006-09-27  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>
        
        * ldapx.test:   New test file for the ldapx entry functions.
                        Thanks to Pierre David for providing it.
                        
2006-09-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* ldapx.man: Fixed ambigous subsection titles reported by Larry
	  Virden via [SF Tcllib Bug 1565836]. Additionally fixed a syntax
	  error (missing closed double-apostroph) in an example.

2006-09-24  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ldap.tcl	Fixed bug in secure_connect. The
			channel wasn't fconfigured correctly and
			the fileevent handler was not installed
			in the correct way.

2006-09-22  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ldap.test	Added some more smoketests for the public
			API, so that at least some brokenness is
			detected.

2006-09-20  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ldap.tcl      Completly redone broken error handling in
          pkgIndex.tcl  the fileevent handler, now it no
          ldap.man      longer calls bgerror but cleans up
                        the outstanding messages for the
                        connection and delivers the error
                        to those waiting handlers. More stupid
                        typo fixes.

        * ldapx.tcl     Some bugfixes for error handling
          ldap.tcl      when searchInit is called with invalid
          ldap.man      arguments. Thanks to Pierre David 
          pkgIndex.tcl  <pdav@users.sourceforge.net> for finding
                        them.

2006-09-15  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ldapx.tcl     Some more fixes in the ldif part.

        * ldapx.tcl     Imported some bug fixes from a new
          ldapx.man     version of ldapx by Pierre David.
          pkgIndex.tcl  Fixed bug in modifyDN, fixed wrong start
                        of SASL handshake, some mechanisms require
                        the client to send first.

        * ldap.tcl      Fixed broken length calculation in message receiver.
          pkgIndex.tcl  This fixes bug [SF Tcllib Bug 1558564].
                        Fixed various smaller bugs with upvaring handles
                        in info functions.
                        Fixed wrong debug setting.
                        
2006-09-11  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ldap.tcl      Fixed missing tlsHandshakeInProgress variable when
          ldap.man      when using ldap::connect.
          pkgIndex.tcl
          
2006-09-08  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ldapx.tcl     New subpackage ldapx provides a snit
          ldapx.man     based OO wrapper around the ldap package.
          pkgIndex.tcl  Based on patch [SF Tcllib Patch 1545931]
                        by Pierre David <pdav@users.sourceforge.net>.
          
2006-09-01  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ldap.tcl      Major changes to the implementation.
          ldap.man      The package now uses a fileevent based
          ldap.test     protocol handler instead of the older blocking
          pkgIndex.tcl  calls.
          SASL.txt
          
          ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
          Connection failures are no longer handled in the blocking
          ldap::* commands, instead they appear in the fileevent handler
          and have to be handled with a bgerror procedure.
          
          I will add a per handle -errorcallback to the package soon, 
          which will allow user specified handlers, but those are not
          yet done.
          
          Applied modified patches [SF Tcllib Patches 1542666, 1541828],
          thanks to Pierre David for comments and code.
          
          In addition to this change experimental new (sub-)commands
          were added:
          
          This change introduces new subcommands to ldap::info:
          
          saslmechanisms - show the supported SASL mechanisms
          features       - show the supported server features
          control        - show the supported server controls
          extensions     - show the supported server extensions 
          whoami         - show the current authzId
          
          In addition it introduces a new ldap::starttls command,
          which allows to upgrade an existing connection to TLS,
          if the tls extension is present and the server supports it.
          This may be part of a fix for [Tcllib Bug # 1403369].
          
          There is also a new ldap::bindSASL command available,
          which allows a SASL based bind with the help of the
          tcllib SASL package. See the SASL.txt file for an example.
          
          The code has been tested a bit against OpenLDAP 2.3, but is
          not entirely stable yet.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Thanks to Pierre David for comments.
                        Version raised to 1.5

			namespace imports the appropriate code.

	* ldap.tcl: Reformatted to get clean indentation, also trimmed
