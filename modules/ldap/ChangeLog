        * ldap.tcl      Major changes to the implementation.
          ldap.man      The package now uses a fileevent based
          ldap.test     protocol handler instead of the older blocking
          pkgIndex.tcl  calls.
          SASL.txt
          
          ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
          Connection failures are no longer handled in the blocking
          ldap::* commands, instead they appear in the fileevent handler
          and have to be handled with a bgerror procedure.
          
          I will add a per handle -errorcallback to the package soon, 
          which will allow user specified handlers, but those are not
          yet done.
          
          Applied modified patches [SF Tcllib Patches 1542666, 1541828],
          thanks to Pierre David for comments and code.
          
          In addition to this change experimental new (sub-)commands
          were added:
          
          This change introduces new subcommands to ldap::info:
          
          saslmechanisms - show the supported SASL mechanisms
          features       - show the supported server features
          control        - show the supported server controls
          extensions     - show the supported server extensions 
          whoami         - show the current authzId
          
          In addition it introduces a new ldap::starttls command,
          which allows to upgrade an existing connection to TLS,
          if the tls extension is present and the server supports it.
          This may be part of a fix for [Tcllib Bug # 1403369].
          
          There is also a new ldap::bindSASL command available,
          which allows a SASL based bind with the help of the
          tcllib SASL package. See the SASL.txt file for an example.
          
          The code has been tested a bit against OpenLDAP 2.3, but is
          not entirely stable yet.

        * ldap.tcl    : Applied patch from [SF Tcllib Bug 1191326].
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Thanks to Pierre David for comments.
                        Version raised to 1.5
			Removed the duplicated asn code from the
			module, it now package requires asn 0.6 and
			namespace imports the appropriate code.

	* ldap.tcl (ldap::asnGetInteger): Fixed [SF Tcllib Bug 1164663], a

	* ldap.tcl: Reformatted to get clean indentation, also trimmed
	  trailing whitespace.

2005-02-15  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ldap.tcl: Fixed various issue with signed/unsigned integers in
	  length and integer encoding/decoding, by crossporting the 64-bit
	  aware integer and length code from the asn module.
