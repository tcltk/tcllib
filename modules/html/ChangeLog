        * modules/html/html.tcl:
        Removed the 'html::resolveUrl' procedure because it provided
        the same functionality as the uri::resolve function, only
        html::resolveUrl was undocumented and untested and as a result
        did not seem to work as well as uri::resolve.

	* modules/html/html.tcl:
	Changed html::textInput to take "args" for additional stuff to
	put into the <text> tag instead of "defaultValue".  The ncgi
	module now has ncgi::setDefaultValue for that purpose.

2000-06-04  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>
