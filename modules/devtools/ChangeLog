	* testutilities.tcl: Added commands for the loading of files and
	  packages from the Tcllib under test. This will reduce the amount
	  of boilerplate in a .test file spent on getting the package
	  under test, its supporting packages, and other helper files.

2006-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Moved the definitions of the common
	  constraints out of the toplevel "all.tcl" into the test support
	  code.

2006-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: New file for boilerplate code and common
	  commands used by most to all testsuites in Tcllib.

	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.8 ========================
	* 

2004-10-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dialog.tcl: More log output for better tracing of the
	  internals. Especially added trace when receiving an incomplete
	  line while waiting for data from the peer. Added code to clean
	  up old connections, prevent leakage of channel handles.

2004-10-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* muserv.tcl:  Removed the old facilities for sub processes
	* musub.tcl:   and programmed interactions. They have been
	* subserv.tcl: superceded by the code below.

	* coserv.tcl: New sub process mgmt based on "comm".
	* dialog.tcl: New code for programmed dialogs based on
	  "coserv.tcl".

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* subserv.tcl (muserv): Propagate the auto_path into the
	  subprocess so that it is able to find all packages the server
	  might require. Without that the server will need an installed
	  tcllib, for example. This fixes a hang in the pop3 testsuite
	  when tcllib is not installed.

2003-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* New module. 
	* First contents are support for sub-processes in testsuites.
