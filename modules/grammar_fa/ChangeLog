	* faop.tcl:       operations packages to break their circularity.
	* fa.test:        The user of the operations packages now has to

	* tests/fa_is_deterministic.test:
	* tests/fa_is_useful.test:
	* tests/da_cons.test:   Introduced constraint 'runtotal'.
	* tests/de_cons.test:   Skip the most timeconsuming tests

	  command.

2004-07-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* faop.man: Inserted the correct package names into the
	* fa.man:   manpage headers.

	* fa.test:        (list, set operations). Updated all test
	* faop.test:      suites in the same way. Updated all manpages
	* dacceptor.tcl:  to contain the correct package requirements
	* dexec.tcl:      as well.
	* fa.tcl: 
	* faop.tcl: 
	* dacceptor.man:

	* dacceptor.man: Slight renaming of a section for better
	  understanding.

	* dexec.tcl:  New package, execution of deterministic 
	* dexec.man:  finite automatons. Executors can do only this,

	* tests/de_cons.test:
	* tests/de_exec.test:

2004-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dacceptor.tcl:  New package, deterministic acceptors
	* dacceptor.man:  out of deterministic finite automaton.
	* dacceptor.test: Acceptors do only this check, and cannot
	* fa.man:         be manipulated. Added reference to this
	                  package to the FA documenation.
	* tests/da_cons.test:
	* tests/da_accept.test:

	* fa.tcl:  Added fromRegex constructor operation. Updated
	* fa.man:  the documentation, and testsuite. Typo fixes in
	* fa.test: documentation as well.

2004-04-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* faop.tcl: Complement requires deterministic input for a correct
	* faop.man: result. Fixed. Updated documentation as well. Typo
	  fixes in doc.

2004-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test_support.tcl: Renamed to tests.support. Prevents the
	* fa.test:          installation of this internal file.
	* faop.test:        Updated the test suites.

2004-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All files: Bugfixes in basic FA support. Updated tests, updated
	  documentation. Completed implementation of more comlex FA
	  operations, their documentation, and their tests. Test suite is
	  now definitely in overkill, taking 13 minutes to run :P

2004-03-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fa_state.test
	* tests/fa_is_complete.test
	* tests/fa_is_cons.test
	* fa.tcl: Fixed definition of 'is complete' for FAs without
	  symbols. Updated tests. Fixed deletion of states, added test for
	  the fixed case. Aded construction from serialization. Updated
	  tests. Added cache for epsilon closures.

	* fa.man: Removed the remnants of the documentation for 'state
	  priority'. Added the missing documentation for all 'is' commands
	  beyond 'deterministic'.

2004-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* New module: Grammar operations, Finite Automatons.
