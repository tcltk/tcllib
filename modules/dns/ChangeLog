	* dns.man: 
	* dns.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Version up to 1.0.1

	* dns.tcl: moved var initialization code to the end, as it uses
	  the 'dns::configure' command, and thus should be called after
	  its definition. This is the reason for bug #564670, thus now
	  fixed.

	* dns.man: Added note to manpage regarding DNS via TCP and
	  possible pitfalls.
