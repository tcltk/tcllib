2003-08-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added documentation for the new 'install' command.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::install): Added 'install' command,
	which is similar in functionality to the Unix install command - it
	is basically file copy with some additional features.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for 'install' fileutil command.

2003-07-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.5.1 as this is a bug fix. Any bug fixes and
	  more minor changes coming in the future do not have to bump the
	  version number anymore until the next release. Only a major
	  change warrants another bump before the release.

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed SF tcllib bug [647974]. We now ignore
	  device/inode information if the current path is in a virtual
	  filesystem. We also assume now that VFS's do not support links,
	  thus also obviating the need for the data, circles cannot occur.

2003-05-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::tempfile): Braced [expr].

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-01  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:   The touch command cannot be implemented in Tcl
	* fileutil.test:  versions < 8.3 so do not define the command.
	* fileutil.man:   Noted in documentation and skipped tests.

2003-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added command [tempfile]. Was part of tcllib patch
	  611595, but has a better place here.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  Set version of the package to to 1.5.

2003-04-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test (fileutil): Fixed tcllib SF bug #714214 reported
	  by Pat Thoyts, by working around the 'makeFile' command provided
	  with tcltest. It seems to have issues when doing binary data.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::touch): Applied patch #688965 provided
	  by Glenn Jackman <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net>. This patch
	  provides a better message when asking the [fileutil::touch]
	  command for help.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed bug #707009, reported by Helmut Giese
	  <hgiese@users.sourceforge.net>, also updated the documentation
	  and the testsuite.

2003-01-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Use 'string match' instead
	  of regexp.  Require Tcl 8.2.

2003-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.

2002-10-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.test: Accepted enhanced format detection by Philip
	  Ehrens <pehrens@ligo.caltech.edu>.

2002-05-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (cat): Fixed bug #556504, reported by Michael
	  A. Cleverly <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net>. The fix was
	  provided by Michael too. The problem was reading files which are
	  reported as size 0, but actually have content, just dynamically
	  generated (Linux /proc is an example of an fs containing such
	  files).

2002-05-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Documented the two new commands (stripN,
	  stripPwd).

	* fileutil.tcl: Made up my mind about SF Bug #462015. The proposed
	  interface change to [find] is rejected to keep the interface of
	  the library procedure simple and without hidden surprises =
	  KISS. Added a command [stripPwd] instead which can be used by
	  the caller of [find] to make the returned paths relative to the
	  current working directory. Also added [stripN] to strip a fixed
	  number of elements from the beginning of a path.

2002-04-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Added doctools manpage.
	* fileutils.n: Updated to reflect change of version.

2002-03-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Bumped version to 1.4
	
	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added fileType command posted to comp.lang.tcl by
	  Phil Ehrens, with some minor modifications.

2002-01-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.3

2001-12-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Restricted tests 2.2 and 2.3 to the directory
	  structure created for the test and not the whole directory the
	  test is run in. Bugfix for item #486572.

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.tcl: Applied patch #477805 by Glenn Jackman
	  <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net> implementing the unix 'touch'
	  command. Contains documentation and testsuite for the new
	  command too.

2001-09-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Restricted export list to public API.
	  [456255]. Patch by Hemang Lavana
	  <hemanglavana@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-08-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All of the changes below are related to tcllib Patch [449531] by
	  Anselm Lingnau <lingnau@users.sourceforge.net>. Instead of
	  taking in the proposed highlevel 'fileinput' I added some of the
	  more low-level commands from Tclx which can be used to
	  create/compose 'fileinput'.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Moved version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for the new commands. Moved version
	  of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.n: Added documentation of the new commands. Moved
	  version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.tcl (findByPattern, foreachLine): New commands, modeled
	  after TclX's 'recursive_glob' and 'for_file'. Moved version of
	  fileutil to 1.2.

2001-07-31  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.n: Added manpage documenting the commands. tcllib Bug
	  [446584].

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2001-03-20  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: [Bug #410104, Patch #410106]
	  New implementation of ::fileutil::find for unixoid OSs using
	  stat and device/inode configuration to detect and break circular
	  softlink structures. This implementation also skips un'stat'able
	  files and directories.

	* fileutil.test: Added fileutil-1.4 testing the circle breaker
	  (only under unix).

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added cat function, duplicates standard UNIX "cat"
	  utility.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test: Collected tests into one file; adapted tests for
	  use in/out of tcllib test framework.
