	* autoproxy.tcl: Dealt with the parsing requirements as mentioned
	* autoproxy.man: in bug #1099162. In theory we may have different
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  proxy settings for https and http (and other
	protocols) but to deal with these we will need to change the http
	package so we do not deal with them now.
