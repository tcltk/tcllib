	* ncgi.test: Fixed tests that created files with "source ncgi.tcl"
	in them to use full path for sourcing, so that tests could be run
	from any directory. [Bug: 4393]

	* ncgi.tcl: added ncgi::reset so the ncgi package can be used inside
	TclHttpd

	* ncgi.test: added ncgi::reset tests, renumbered everything, and
	switch most tests to use ncgi::reset

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Added package index file.

	* ncgi.test: Added code to add source dir to auto_path, so that 
	tests could be run on uninstalled package.  Added call to 
	tcltest::cleanupTests.
