[section OVERVIEW]

[subsection {What is this document?}]

This document is currently mainly a placeholder, to be filled with
commonly asked questions about the doctoc markup language and
companions, and their answers.

[para]

Please report any questions (and, if possible, answers) we should
consider for this document in the category [emph doctools] of the
[uri {http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883} {Tcllib SF Trackers}].

[section EXAMPLES]

[subsection {Where do I find doctoc examples?}]

markup. However the doctools processor [syscmd dtplite] does generate
a table of contents when processing a set of documents written in
doctools markup. The intermediate file for it uses doctoc markup and
is not deleted when generation completes. Such files can therefore
serve as examples.

[para]

[syscmd dtplite] is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you
need one of
