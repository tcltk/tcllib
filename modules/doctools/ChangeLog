	* mpformats/_html.tcl: Added command to map HTML special
	  characters to their escape sequences.

	* mpformats/fmt.latex: Added code to disable special processing of
	  plain text while inside of an example.

	* mpformats/fmt.tmml: Added HandleText call to [example] to handle
	  special XML characters inside of the example. Not requitred for
	  [example_begin] / [example_end] as the text will go through
	  HandleText automatically for that case.

	* mpformats/fmt.nroff: Added split to lsearch statement in
	  manpage_end to make the code robust against strings which are
	  not valid lists.

	* New module. Application module providing a simple tcl-based
	  manpage markup language and a processor for converting this
	  format to TMML, nroff and HTML. Extensible, i.e. additional
	  formats can be added without to much work (Manpages for format
	  and internal interfaces are provided).
