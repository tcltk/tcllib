TYPE VARIABLES

Snit_info               Introspection Array.  Keys and values are as
                        follows:
    
    counter		Integer counter.  Used to generate unique names.
    widgetclass         Tk widget class name for snit::widgets
    hulltype            Hull widget type (frame or toplevel) for
                        snit::widgets.
    ns			The type namespace, "$type::". UNUSED.
    exceptmethods       Method names excluded from delegate method *.
    excepttypemethods   Typemethod names excluded from delegate typemethod *.
    tvardecs            Type variable declarations--for dynamic
                        methods.
    ivardecs            Instance variable declarations--for dynamic
                        methods.

Snit_isWidget           Boolean; true if the object is a widget or 
                        widgetadaptor. 
                        
                        * Could live in Snit_info.
                        * Can this be resolved at compile time?

Snit_isWidgetAdaptor    Boolean; true if the object is a
                        widgetadaptor.

                        * Could live in Snit_info.
                        * Can this be resolved at compile time?

Snit_typemethodInfo     Array(method name) = {<pattern> <compName>}
                        where <compName> is "" for normal typemethods
                        and "method name" can be "*".  Used in
                        typemethod cache lookup to create the command
                        for the named typemethod.

Snit_typecomponents     Array(typecomponent name) = command_name
                        Used whenever we need to retrieve the 
                        typecomponent's command.

Snit_typeMethodCache    Array(typemethod name) = cached command
                        Used in typemethod dispatch.

Snit_methodInfo         Array(method name) = {<pattern> <compName>}
                        where <compName> is "" for normal methods and
                        "method name" can be "*".  Used in 
                        method cache lookup to create the command for
                        the named method.

Snit_optionInfo         An array of option data.  The keys are as follows:

  General fields:

    local               List of local option names.

    delegated           List of explicitly delegated option names.

    except              List of option names explicitly NOT delegated 
                        by "delegate option *".

  Fields defined for all locally defined and explicitly delegated options:

    islocal-$opt         1 if local, 0 otherwise.

    resource-$opt        The option's resource name.
                
    class-$opt           The option's class name.

  Fields defined only for locally defined options

    default-$localOpt    Default value.

    validate-$localOpt   The name of the validate method, or "".

    configure-$localOpt  The name of the configure method, or "".

    cget-$localOpt       The name of the cget method, or "".

  Fields defined only for delegated options, including "*".

    delegated-$comp      List of option names delegated to this component.

    target-$opt         [list component targetOptionName].
                        The target option name is missing for
                        option "*".

INSTANCE VARIABLES

Snit_instance           Current name of the instance command.

Snit_components         Array(component name) = command_name
                        Used whenever we need to retrieve the
                        component's command.

Snit_methodCache        Array(method name) = cached command
                        Used during method dispatch.
