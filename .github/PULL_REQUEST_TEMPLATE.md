Hello.

You are currently using the github __mirror__ of the Tcllib sources.

This is __not__ the location where development takes place.

We are not tracking issues entered here.  With the exception of the
maintainer of the mirroring setup nobody will even see such issues.

Please go to the
[official location of the sources](https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib)
and enter your ticket into the
[official ticket tracker](https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist)
instead.

Thank you for your consideration.
