Hello. __Attention please__

You are currently using the github __mirror__ of the Tcllib sources.

This is __not__ the location where Tcllib development takes place.

We are __not tracking issues entered here__. With the exception of the
maintainer of the mirroring setup nobody will even see such issues.

Please go to the
[official location of the sources](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib)
and enter your ticket into the
[official ticket tracker](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/reportlist)
instead.

Thank you for your consideration.
