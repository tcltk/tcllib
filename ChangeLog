	* Makefile.in:  added pop3 module.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Instead of probing install dir for modules, changed to
	take module list on command line, so that users can change what goes into
	the pkgIndex.tcl from the Makefile.
	
	* Makefile.in: additional work on module list and pkgIndex.tcl generation.
	Now changing the module list changes what is installed and what is
	put in the pkgIndex.tcl.

    * Makefile.in: Work on install-libraries, install-doc; removed
    references to compiled bits.

    * mkIndex.tcl.in: Tweaked the generated pkgIndex.tcl to only
    append the dirname if it doesn't already exist in the auto_path,
    and to use \[file dirname \[info script\]\] instead of [pwd].

    * configure:
    * configure.in: Removed checks for compiler, and all stuff related
    to compiling/linking (this is a tcl only extension).

    * tcl.m4: new tcl.m4 from sample extension.
