	* modules/html/html.tcl: Added html::refresh to generate
	META tags that cause a page to refresh.

2000-05-06  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed bug 5383, where smtp wouldn't work because
	it had a dependency on Trf.  I've patched the code, and it seems
	to work fine now.

2000-05-03  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* cmdline/cmdline.tcl:
	Changed cmdline::getopt to set boolean arguments to
	0 or 1 explicitly.  Previously it just set the value
	to "" if it was present, or did nothing.  This vfixes
	the -verbose command line bug in connect.

2000-05-02  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* ncgi/ncgi.tcl:
	Moved the '+' decoding from nvlist down into ncgi::decode.
	Changed ncgi::value to strip out the structure associated with
	multipart/form-data values.  Use ncgi::valueList to get the
	structured value.

2000-04-28  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mkInstallScripts.tcl: Fixed a bug in the UNIX shell script where
	it was checking if TCLINSTALL was non-null, but it was using ==,
	which isn't legal in /bin/sh.  I found this out the hard way while
	trying to install tcllib0.4 in the default location
	(/usr/local/lib/tcllib0.4) and because of this bug, it ended up
	installing in /lib/tcllib0.4.
	
2000-04-26  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* html/html.tcl:  Added urlResove and urlParent URL parsing
	routines.

2000-04-26  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped patchlevel to 0.4
	* Makefile.in: Fixed dist target to deal with missing manual
	pages and test files.
	* ncgi/ncgi.tcl, ncgi.test: changed names to get capitalization
	right: setCookie, valueList, importAll, urlStub
	* html/html.tcl: track name changes in ncgi
	* mkInstallScripts.tcl: Made install directory a parameter to
	the unix install.sh script

2000-04-25  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* modules/mime/mime.test: Added a somewhat rudimentary test suite
	for TclMIME.  Found what I believe is a minor bug in the package,
	but decided not to fix it (and just let the relevant test fail)
	until I can discuss it with Brent.

2000-04-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Tweaked dist target to include README and
	license.terms in distributions.

2000-04-24  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>
	
	* html/html.tcl, html.test: Cleanup of procedure names in html package.
	* html/html.n:	Updates to the man page
	* htmlhtml.test: 60% through tests

2000-04-17  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* html/html.tcl: Added html generation module
	* ncgi/ncgi.tcl: Fixed ncgi::reset with no query data.
	Fixed ncgi::multipart because it usually gets \r\n data

2000-04-10  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: restored ncgi module

2000-04-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* configure: 
	* configure.in: Upped version to 0.3.

2000-03-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl: Added missing "== -1" to [lsearch] for package dir
	in generated pkgIndex.tcl.

2000-03-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added $(srcdir)/ prefix to mkIndex.tcl call in the
	install-libraries target, so that it would find the mkIndex.tcl
	script when run outside of the source tree.  Same for man.macros
	in the install-doc target, so it would find the file.

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added dist target for building distribution.

	* configure.in: Removed mkIndex.tcl from AC_OUTPUT call.

	* mkInstallScripts.tcl: First cut at script for autogenerating
	simple INSTALL.BAT and install.sh files for tcllib distributions.

	* mkIndex.tcl: 
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Replace mkIndex.tcl.in with mkIndex.tcl, which
	now takes more args to specify values.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added ncgi module, commented out until tests are done.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Updated test target to call out to all.tcl.

	* all.tcl: First checkin of all.tcl, the magic that hides behind
	"make test".

2000-03-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Commented out cgi module until it's ready for use.
	Added checks for bogus module names in install-libraries, but
	they're not foolproof.

2000-03-07  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* modules/mime/mime.tcl: Modified this to have a soft dependency on
	the Trf package.  If it is available then the encoding and decoding
	of MIME base64 and quoted-printable will run faster.
	Also added mime::buildmessage that creates the structured MIME message
	in a string and returns that - much like mime::copymessage that
	copies the message to a channel.

	* modules/cgi/cgi.tcl: Preliminary version of a CGI module.  Still
	needs some cookie functions, test suite, and docs...

2000-03-07  Eric Melski <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* modules/math: math library

	* Makefile.in: added math library to list of modules

2000-03-07  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in: 
	* configure: 
	* aclocal.m4:
	* Makefile.in: Changed to use shared config subdirectory.  Also
	fixed problem on Windows builds where it would fail to identify
	the tclsh executable to use.  Simplified configure.in to minimum
	number of macros.

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* man.macros: Moved from individual modules to toplevel tcllib
	dir, so that it is not repeated hundreds of times.
	
	* Makefile.in:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Added version number to installed tcllib dir.

	* license.terms: Adapted license from Tcl.
	
	* README: Added more information about file layout in module dirs.

2000-03-06  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in:  added pop3 module.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Instead of probing install dir for modules,
	changed to take module list on command line, so that users can
	change what goes into the pkgIndex.tcl from the Makefile.
	
	* Makefile.in: additional work on module list and pkgIndex.tcl
	generation.  Now changing the module list changes what is
	installed and what is put in the pkgIndex.tcl.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Work on install-libraries, install-doc; removed
	references to compiled bits.

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Tweaked the generated pkgIndex.tcl to only
	append the dirname if it doesn't already exist in the auto_path,
	and to use \[file dirname \[info script\]\] instead of [pwd].

	* configure:
	* configure.in: Removed checks for compiler, and all stuff related
	to compiling/linking (this is a tcl only extension).

	* tcl.m4: new tcl.m4 from sample extension.

2000-03-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added fileutil, cmdline, mime, base64 modules.

2000-02-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in, et al: Preliminary Makefile and configure script, and
	supporting files
