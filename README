Welcome to the tcllib, the Tcl Standard Library.  This package is
intended to be a collection of Tcl packages that provide utility
functions useful to a large collection of Tcl programmers.

The structure of the tcllib source heirarchy is:

tcllib
 +- modules
     +- <module1>
     +- <module2>
     +- ...


The install heirarchy is:

.../lib/tcllib
        +- <module1>
        +- <module2>
        +- ...

There are some base requirements that a module must meet before it
will be added to tcllib:

* the module must be a proper Tcl package
* the module must use a namespace for its commands and variables
* the name of the package must be the same as the name of the
  namespace
* the module must reside in a subdirectory of the modules directory in
  the source heirarchy, and that subdirectory must have the same name
  as the package and namespace
* the module must be released under the BSD License, the terms of
  which can be found in the toplevel tcllib source directory
* the module should have both documentation (in XML, man, or HTML
  form) and a test suite (in the form of a group of *.test files in
  the module directory).
* the module must have either documentation or a test suite.  It can
  not have neither.
* the module should adhere to Tcl coding standards

When adding a module to tcllib, be sure to add it to the Makefile.in
so it will be installed.  Add a line like:

MYNEWMODULE=mynewmodule

to the list of modules at the top of the Makefile.in, and then add
$(MYNEWMODULE) to the definition of the MODULES variable.  This will
allow users to choose which modules to install by commenting or
uncommenting lines in the Makefile.
